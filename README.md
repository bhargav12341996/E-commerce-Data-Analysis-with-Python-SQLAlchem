📦 E-commerce Data Analysis with Python & SQLAlchemy 🛒

I recently built a project where I automated the process of loading E-commerce datasets (orders, products, aisles, departments) into PostgreSQL using Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy.

🔹 The Challenge
Manually importing multiple CSVs into SQL is time-consuming and error-prone — especially when analyzing large-scale retail data.

🔹 The Solution
I created a Python pipeline that:
✅ Reads multiple CSVs (orders, products, aisles, departments)
✅ Automatically creates & loads tables in PostgreSQL
✅ Uses SQLAlchemy for smooth database connectivity
✅ Runs in one script to make the database analysis-ready

🔹 Why This Matters for E-commerce
With the data loaded into SQL, I can now:
📊 Analyze top-selling products
📦 Track order frequency and reorder behavior
🛍️ Understand trends across aisles & departments
📈 Build a foundation for BI dashboards & customer insights

🔹 Benefits

- Automates repetitive manual data loading

- Improves scalability (works for thousands → millions of rows)

- Ensures data quality & consistency

- Saves time so the focus is on insights, not setup
